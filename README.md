# AccessControlAWS
The project focuses on implementing access control in AWS, divided into three parts:

1. Setup: Secure accounts by implementing MFA, creating an admin group with policies, and setting up admin accounts.
2. Monitoring: Configure AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs to track and monitor activities.
3. IAM and Entitlements: Create user groups and policies, such as EC2ApplicationAdmin, to manage instance permissions and test them in AWS.
